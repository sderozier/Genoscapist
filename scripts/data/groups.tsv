50	33853802	Germination	G135_1	Purified spores were obtained by growing cells in DSM medium (P. Schaeffer, J. Millet, J. P. Aubert, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 54, 704, Sep, 1965) at 37°C for 48 hours after which they were washed ten times in ice cold distilled water over a period of 5 days. Purified spores were heat activated at 70°C  in Tris 10 mM pH 8.4 and germination was initiated by the addition of L-alanine 10 mM (A. Moir, J Bacteriol 146, 1106, Jun, 1981). After incubation for one hour at 37°C, the culture was diluted with an equal volume of 2X LB medium and germinating cells were harvested at 135, 150 or 180 minutes after addition of L-alanine [G135, G150 and G180].	time =135min after L-alanine addition 	exp.

58	42359802	Competence	C30_1	Cells grown overnight on LB agar plates at 30°C were harvested and used to inoculate pre-warmed minimal medium at OD600 of 0.5 (D. Dubnau, R. Davidoff-Abelson, J Mol Biol 56, 209, Mar 14, 1971). After growth at 37°C with vigorous shaking, cells were diluted ten times in fresh pre-warmed minimal medium and samples were harvested after  a period of 30 minutes [C30] , i.e. before maximal induction of competence, and after a period of 90 minutes [C90], i.e. when competence induction was maximal.	time =30min after competence induction 	exp.

70	32815202	Biofilm formation	BT_1	 A fresh colony grown on an LB plate was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB and grown for 10 hours at 30°C. This culture was used to inoculate 10 ml of MSgg medium (S.S. Branda et al., J Bacteriol 186, 3970, Jun, 2004) and incubated with vigorous shaking. The cultures in MSgg were diluted to the same extent in 96 wells microtiterplates (5 μl for 1.5 ml of medium) and incubated without shaking at 30°C. Cells from the control cultures were harvested after 24 hours of incubation [BT]. Biofilms were harvested from 96 well plates after incubation for 36 hours [B36] and 60 hours [B60].	24h of growth with shaking	exp. N°1	24	This work (Jouy)

76	27733402	Growth phases [M9]	M9exp_1	Cells were grown in M9 supplemented with glucose (0.3 %) at 37°C with vigorous shaking. The composition of the M9 minimal medium is (per liter): 8.5 g Na2HPO4.2H20, 3 g KH2PO4, 1 g NH4Cl and 0.5 g NaCl.  The following solutions were individually sterilized and added (volumes per liter of medium): 1 ml 0.1 M CaCl2.2H2O, 1 ml 1 M MgSO4.7H2O, 1 ml 50 mM Fe-Citrate.  Also added was 10 ml of a trace salts solution containing (per liter): 170 mg ZnCl2, 100 mg MnCl2.4H2O, 60 mg CoCl2.6H2O, 60 mg Na2MoO4.2H2O and 43 mg CuCl2.2H2O.  Overnight cultures were diluted 2000-fold in pre-warmed M9 medium and samples were harvested during exponential growth [M9exp], at the transition phase [M9tran] and during stationary phase [M9stat].

85	15402302	Carbon sources	M+G_1	A  5 ml aliquot of LB medium was inoculated using frozen culture stocks. After a few hours growth at 37°C, precultures were prepared by inoculating 5 ml of M9 with this LB culture at several different dilutions usually ranging from  500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen so that one of these precultures had grown to and OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight inculation.  The chosen M9 medium precultures  [at OD600 of 0.5 - 1.0] were used to inoculate 100 mL of M9 medium in 500 mL non-baffled shake flasks to an OD600 of 0.02. Filter-sterilized carbon sources were added separately to the medium M9 at following concentration: D-Glucose 3g/L[Glu], L-Malic acid 4.5g/L[Mal], L-Malic acid + D-Glucose  3 and 2g/L[M+G], D-Fructose 3g/L[Fru], D-Gluconate 4g/L[Glucon], Pyruvate 6g/L[Pyr], Glycerol 6g/L[Gly], Glutamic acid + Succinic acid 2 and 2g/L[G+S]. Where necessary, carbon source solutions were pH neutralized with 4 M NaOH prior to addition to the medium. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase. 	O.D.600  approx. 0.5	exp.

109	32848902	Anaerobic growth	aero_1	Cells were grown in a synthetic medium (E. Härtig, A. Hartmann, M. Schätzle, A. M. Albertini, D. Jahn, Appl Environ Microbiol 72, 5260, 2006) at 37 °C. For aerobic growth, an overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of the synthetic medium to a starting OD578 of 0.05.  The culture was then incubated in a 500 ml baffled flask with shaking at 250 rpm [aero].  Anaerobic growth was carried out (i) in the presence of 10 mM potassium nitrate (nitrate respiration) [nit];  or (ii) in the absence of 10 mM postassium nitrate (fermentative growth) [ferm].  The procedure for anaerobic growth was: medium was inoculated to an OD578 nm of 0.1 in flasks completely filled with medium and sealed with rubber stoppers.  They were shaken at 100 rpm to minimize cell aggregation. These cultures were inoculated aerobically with an aerobically grown overnight culture. Anaerobic conditions were achieved in the stoppered flasks after a short time through the consumption of residual oxygen. Cells were harvested during the exponential growth phase.

210	10236302	Nutritional shifts glucose/malate	GM-0.1_1	A culture of LB medium was inocualted from a frozen glycerol stock of B. subtilis. After few hours at 37oC when the culture was growing exponentially, this culture was used to inoculate M9 minimal medium at several different dilutions usually in the range of 500- to 2000-fold. The dilution range was chosen to ensure that at least one of these M9 precultures had reached an OD600  between 0.5 - 1.0 after overnight incubation. These precultures were then used to inoculate 2.5 L of M9 medium in a 3.1 L KLF bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland) to a starting OD600  of 0.03 – 0.05. Condiions in the bioreactor were rigorously controlled as follows: temperature was controlled at 37 °C; the pH was maintained at exactly 7.2 by automatic titration with 2.0 M KOH and 2.0 M H2SO4, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained above 50%. In each nutritional shift experiment cells were grown on the single substrate until the OD600 reached 0.50, at which point the second substrate was added instantaneously (4 g/L L-malate or 3 g/L glucose). The nutrient shifts performed were from glucose to glucose+malate [GM] and from malate to malate+glucose [MG] (Buescher et al., accompanying paper). Cell growth during the course was monitored throughout the experiment by measuring OD600. 	before addition of malate	exp. N°1 	83	Buescher et al., accompanying paper
